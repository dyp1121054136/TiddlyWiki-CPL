Moreover, a css class (`hzone-focus`) is added to the tiddler frame to allow css styling.\n\n!! Inspiration\n\nYou could write a small widget that listens to the changes of `$:/temp/focussedTiddler` to \n\n* Unfold the table of contents or highlight the current topic.\n* Change the page title\n* Update the permalink in the address bar\n* Log the user behavior\n* Highlight the focussed tiddler\n\nTiddlyMap uses the HotZone plugin to update its live view in the sidebar.
