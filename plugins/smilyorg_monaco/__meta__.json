{"title":"$:/plugins/smilyorg/monaco","author":"Miha Lunar","name":"Monaco","description":"Monaco Editor packaged for TiddlyWiki","readme":"<$button class=\"tc-btn-invisible\" style=\"overflow: hidden;white-space: pre;width: 100%;\" message=\"tm-open-external-window\" param=\"https://github.com/smilyorg/tw5-monaco\">{{$:/core/images/github}} <$text text=\"https://github.com/smilyorg/tw5-monaco\"/></$button>\n\nSupercharged code and text editor component using the excellent [[Monaco Editor|https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/]] - the editor that powers [[Visual Studio Code|https://code.visualstudio.com/]].\n\nThe integration is somewhat basic right now. See below.\n\nInspired by the CodeMirror plugin. Monaco Editor is licensed under MIT, copyright Microsoft. \n\n!! Disclaimer\nThis is very alpha-level code for now,\nso no guarantee that it will not delete\nall your text and tiddlers randomly, brick\nand/or otherwise corrupt your installation.\n\nOf course I don't expect that to happen\nand for what it's worth, I wrote this\nreadme with it, so it seems to work\nalright for what it is.\n\n!! Features\nA lot of the out-of-the-box features of Monaco\nalready work well.\n\n* Syntax highlighting and formatting for TiddlyWiki wikitext, HTML, JS, Markdown\n* Advanced multiselections and editing\n* Scrollbar minimap\n* Tiddler autocompletion\n* Hover tooltips with tiddler contents\n\n!! Limitations\n\n* ''Online only''. The Monaco editor source itself will be loaded remotely from `unpkg.com`, so editing while offline isn't possible at this point.\n* ''No configuration''. Yet?\n* ''Highlighting heuristics''. Wikitext highlighting might not always be accurate due to missing  TiddlyWiki parser text ranges. \n","version":"0.5.0","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.1.21","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"0.5.0","versions":["0.5.0"]}
