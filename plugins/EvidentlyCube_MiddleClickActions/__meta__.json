Example:\n\nThe button will do nothing on click and will create a new draft on middle click.\n\n```\n<$button>\n<$middle-click-actions>\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-new-tiddler\"/>\n</$middle-click-actions>\nDo nothing on Click but create new draft on Middle Click.\n</$button>\n```\n\n<$button>\n<$middle-click-actions>\n<$action-sendmessage $message=\"tm-new-tiddler\"/>\n</$middle-click-actions>\nDo nothing on Click but create new draft on Middle Click.\n</$button>\n\n! Keep in mind\n\n* `<$middle-click-actions/>` widget must be a direct child of the widget/UI element that you want to react to the middle click, since it attaches itself to its parent and listens on clicks on there.\n* The widget does not need to be the first child.\n* Any actions defined inside this widget will be protected from being invoked by any parent widget^^[1]^^\n\n----\n\n!! Footnotes:\n\n[1]: Do keep in mind that it will only be the case with widgets that use the normal way of invoking actions. If the widget uses a custom implementation it can ignore the request to not be invoked, but in practice I highly doubt it will ever be a problem with any other plugin in the wild.","version":"1.0.0","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.2.0","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"1.0.0","versions":{}}
