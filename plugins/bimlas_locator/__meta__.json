What is the Locator exactly?\n\nBefore I explain, let's clarify a few things about TiddlyWiki:\n\n* Tiddlers can contain any data (notes, tasks, phone numbers, photos, music videos, recipes, products, family members, ...)\n* Tiddlers can have tags\n* Tags can be used to \"label\" tiddlers to categorize them (just like hashtags)\n* Tags can be used to create hierarchies, trees (table of contents) by adding the parent tiddler as a tag to the current tiddler\n* Tiddlers can have fields\n* Fields can contain arbitrary data (date, numeric value, text, even a list of other tiddlers) which characterize the tiddler\n* Tags are stored in `tags` field of tiddler\n* Because `tags` is no different from the other fields, ''any field can be used as tags''\n* The links in the text also form a tree\n\nLocator provides a universal interface for navigating between your tiddlers and searching, filtering them without the need to write [[filter expressions|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Filters]]. The plugin contains ''a table of contents macro'' and an enhanced search engine that contains a ''visual filter builder to filter results by tags and field values''. You can organize the tiddlers to any number of trees, even by custom fields or links in text. Unlike [[classic Table of Contents|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Table-of-Contents%20Macros%20(Examples)]], [[standard search|$:/core/ui/AdvancedSearch/Standard]], [[filter search|$:/core/ui/AdvancedSearch/Filter]] and [[list of tags|$:/core/ui/MoreSideBar/Tags]], this plugin handles these functions organically.\n\n''If you have used the previous version, be sure to check [[changelog|$:/plugins/bimlas/locator/README/CHANGELOG]] for incompatible changes.''\n\n!!
