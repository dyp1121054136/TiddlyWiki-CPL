Typograms optimizes for editability and portability (e.g. plain text is easy to maintain, change, store and transmit), at the cost of expressivity (e.g. SVG is more expressive) and ergonomics (e.g. higher level tools produce diagrams faster).","readme":"<$button class=\"tc-btn-invisible\" style=\"overflow: hidden;white-space: pre;width: 100%;\" message=\"tm-open-external-window\" param=\"https://github.com/Speff/typograms-tw5\">{{$:/core/images/github}} <$text text=\"https://github.com/Speff/typograms-tw5\"/></$button>\n\n<$button class=\"tc-btn-invisible\" style=\"overflow: hidden;white-space: pre;width: 100%;\" message=\"tm-open-external-window\" param=\"https://speff.github.io/typograms-tw5/\">{{$:/core/images/home-button}} <$text text=\"https://speff.github.io/typograms-tw5/\"/></$button>\n\n\\define plugin() $:/plugins/Speff/typograms-tw5\n\\define install()\n<$list\n  filter=\"[<transclusion>prefix[{$(plugin)$/readme|$(plugin)$/readme|||}]]\"\n  emptyMessage=\"$(plugin)$\"\n>\n{{ $(plugin)$||$:/core/ui/Components/plugin-info }}\n</$list>\n\\end\n\n\n! typograms-tw5\n\n!! What is it\n\nWrapper for Google's Typograms.js - a javascript library which can render ASCII diagrams into simple diagrams\n<br> Take a look at [[the Typogram page|https://google.github.io/typograms/]] for more details and examples. The source for this plugin can be found [[here|https://github.com/Speff/typograms-tw5]]\n\n!! Calling it\n\nThe renderer can be invoked in one of two ways -\n\n* Via the `<$typogram/>` widget. Typical usage:\n\n<<<\n`<$typogram zoom=0.3 text=\"\"\"\n[ASCII ART HERE]\n\"\"\"/>`\n<br>Note: a `height` attribute can also be passed if needed. `zoom=0.3` is the default value and does not need to be provided\n<<<\n\n* Transclusion via the newly added `text/vnd.tiddlywiki.typogram` content type\n<<<\nA new tiddler can be created with the aforementioned content type which can then be transcluded to other tiddlers. A new dropdown item has been created which can be used to quickly select this type. ''The text in the typogram tiddler should only contain code for the typogram itself''\n<br>Note: custom options such as `height` and `zoom` can't be passed if using this method\n<<<\n\n!! Helper object\n\nDiagramming a typogram is only possible when using a monospace font. A new toolbar button has been included with this plugin to toggle between variable/monospace font for the text editor\n\n!! Installation\n\nManually install the plugin by dragging this link to your TiddlyWiki:\n\n<<install>>\n\nThen save and refresh your TiddlyWiki.
