Usage\n\nAfter install, you have to publish your wiki as a HTTPS website to make it work.\n\n!!! Make sure to include all necessary step in the build process\n\nAdd following files to your `/public` folder after build, you can use a script to copy them to the build folder after the wiki build process:\n\n1. Add a `manifest.webmanifest` like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"background_color\": \"white\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"white\",\n  \"description\": \"Meme of LinOnetwo 林一二的模因和想法 - TiddlyWiki 非线性的知识库和博客\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/TiddlyWikiIconBlack.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"256x256\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/TiddlyWikiIconWhite.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"144x144\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"name\": \"TiddlyWiki\",\n  \"short_name\": \"Wiki\",\n  \"lang\": \"zh-CN\",\n  \"start_url\": \"/\",\n  \"scope\": \"/\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure icon size is at least 144x144. And change all necessary fields.\n\n2. Add `service-worker.js`:\n\nSee [[https://github.com/linonetwo/Meme-of-LinOnetwo/public/service-worker.js|https://github.com/linonetwo/Meme-of-LinOnetwo/blob/d088f72a2b95ee21b68af1b349d9993a3997bf19/Meme-of-LinOnetwo/public/service-worker.js]] for example.\n\n!!! Config router\n\nSometimes request from this plugin to your `service-worker.js` will resulted in 404, this is basically because you are not putting `service-worker.js` just besides your `index.html`, or the router config is wrong.\n","version":"0.0.2","plugin-type":"plugin","core-version":">=5.1.22","requires-reload":false,"category":"Unknown","type":"application/json","latest":"0.0.2","versions":{}}
